I left dozens of comments to the r/Twitter subreddit and they were almost all heavily downvoted. No one was able to show me wrong and they rarely even tried to do so: they just tried to shut me up by downvoting me. Eventually the cowardly mods had had enough of someone intruding on their echo chamber and banned me.

Here are the comments in reverse chronological order. It looks like in many cases the context isn't visible to others since my comments were deleted too.

I'll be posting about this and other topics at r/TwitterExposed.



[SITE]/comments/13xl7yi/does_twitter_penalize_you_for_reposting_the_same/
The first thing to understand about Twitter - pre- and post-Musk - is that they're incompetent fascists. Everything flows from that.

While I see those like LarryElder posting the same images/videos/text and not getting penalized, I'd suggest not trying that yourself unless you have lots of followers. But, I don't think doing it every week would be a problem as long as you make sure to use very different text each time and as long as you've got lots of tweets in between.

The bloggers spread the "disinfo" that paid blue checks are promoted when that's not true of many of them: I keep seeing them in the censored sections of reply pages.

As for their claim about the Klan, how many did they kill? How many blacks have been killed in black-on-black violence relating to Southern fighting culture?



































[SITE]/comments/13xmfu5/how_do_i_prove_to_twitter_that_my_account_is_human/
I have an account that was inactive for six months (I switched to another account because Vijaya censored it). I recently started using it and saw the same message.

I "interacted with my timeline" by blocking Musk and non-political accounts that were promoted to me (cat pics, products, etc). I tweeted from it a bit and after a week I saw another message saying I'd unlocked more features. The fascists then sent my tweets to more people.

Until yesterday, when my account was suspended for trash talking a football team. The same type of thing that happens thousands of times a day. I've appealed their decision.

I went back to the other account (which had been completely shadowbanned but was now somewhat back).

I've been extensively censored by Twitter for years and I've been suspended a few times, but their censorship has never been as extensive as it is since Musk took over.
































[SITE]/comments/13wyl2x/ben_jerrys_ends_paid_advertising_on_twitter_due/
So, you'd be OK with social media where everyone is only allowed to say things that Big  Biz wants to hear? That's not liberal in the least.

Let's say Monsanto has a "show us your garden after Roundup" promo. Ten people dutifully tweet pics of their gardens. You tweet about the problems with Roundup and get censored. Tweets with links to studies finding problems with Roundup get censored.

I realize "liberals" are now mostly just far-left SJWs and very, very pro-corporate, but there have to be a few people here who'd see a problem with that.

(The rest, of course, will downvote this comment into oblivion.)































[SITE]/comments/13ow3zd/comment/jm13vv0/?context=3
Libs are as completely ignorant of what Vijaya/Musk do as cons are.
Paid blue checks are as heavily censored as everyone else. Who's censored on Twitter makes absolutely no sense and has little to do with content.

Actually finding out what Twitter does really isn't that difficult. I'm apparently the only person in the world who knows how to do it.

I got a laptop a while back with Windows installed. I was going to make it dual boot Ubuntu but MSFT showed me similar captchas - 10 of them! - so I just wiped the whole hard drive and made it single boot.




















[SITE]/comments/13ry0fz/twitter_blue_is_probably_not_worth_it/
Blocking Paid Blue Checks to get back at Musk is punching down instead of punching up. Try blocking Tesla-related accounts etc and those who buy ads, not some nobody. Blocking based on ideology is for mental weaklings.

Another smart thing to do is to understand that Twitter calls the tweets after the 'show more replies' link "LowQuality" (even tho they almost always get it wrong). When you see a Paid Blue Check in that section, point out to them that they're paying Musk to be censored.

Now, of course, this comment will be voted down even tho it describes how to make Musk sad.

"Oops, wrong site" explains half the posts here.


































[SITE]/comments/13sjl5a/god_i_love_twitter/
I've compiled similar things, but I include the link and the context. And, unlike everyone else here, I know about the three levels (which Twitter calls "HighQuality", "LowQuality", and "AbusiveQuality") and I tell which levels those are from.

Why don't you compile more cases, but do it in a way that will work?





































[SITE]/comments/13sc2bd/what_is_going_on/
Never fear, the algo is still doing what it was always doing.

Musk really hasn't changed much. In 2019, Vijaya censored half the replies to the president of Iran. In 2023, Musk censored half the replies to the head ayatollah of Iran. Likewise with Chinese govt officials, Russian govt officials, etc etc. They're still being protected from dissent as much as they were before.

The censorship you cheer helps dictatorships. That's not liberal.






























[SITE]/comments/13sk7xm/if_i_had_a_penny/
I've noticed those copycat posts too. At least three of them include "have you noticed" or similar but I'm sure they're from different people.

Also, the smart way to express your displeasure with Musk is to do things like block Tesla-related accounts, Big Biz, Show Biz, etc etc. Blocking based on ideology is, like downvoting based on ideology, for weaklings, but blocking commercial enterprises isn't like that.

























































[SITE]/comments/13ow3zd/comment/jl95r1g/?context=3
I'm not arguing the point, just the idea that dissent vill not be tolerated. Instead of downvoting me, why don't you pull your socks up and go leave your reply as a reply to that tweet? See how your ideas stand up outside this echo chamber.

































[SITE]/comments/13nz574/comment/jl9zndx/?context=3
MMFA, Sleeping Giants, and similar groups try to use Big Biz to limit debate on social media. Companies like Twitter rely on advertising so tend to do what advertisers want. That results in Twitter etc limiting the scope of those who discuss things Big Biz doesn't want.

And, all of that is literally fascism: Mussolini wanted Big Biz to be in charge of everything.

It's fascinating and sad how similar partisan hacks on "both" sides are.

























[SITE]/comments/13o2tvm/is_the_verified_worth_paying_for_if_building/
You won't hear this from anyone else here & I'll, as usual, get downvoted for saying it, but Musk hasn't really changed much. Twitter **heavily** censors their users. Around 25% of users are censored each day for no discernible reason.

And, that includes plenty of paid blue checks. I keep seeing them in the "LowQuality" and "AbusiveQuality" sections. They're being defrauded by Musk.

Don't pay Musk unless you know what those "qualities" are and how to determine if your tweets are impacted.
























[SITE]/comments/13oylfh/show_more_tweets/
Twitter shows that in two cases: when you visit a tweet from an external link when not logged in and it has an "s" in the query string or similar. It only shows a few replies to give more space to hype what Twitter falsely thinks are related tweets.

The other time it shows it is when you click a reply page when logged in and scroll down.

In both cases, the Twitter incompetents show what they think are the "highest quality" tweets at the top even tho they rarely are. In the second case, the tweets after the link are censored. In fact, in the AJAX, Twitter calls those tweets "LowQuality" and the ones above the link "HighQuality". They almost never get that right.

So, hoping for the end of the link in the second case means you'd be helping Twitter censorship.




























[SITE]/comments/13nz574/comment/jl5j3f8/?context=3
I don't even know why I'm replying, but there's a difference between a formal debate and debate in general.



























[SITE]/comments/13nz574/comment/jl5j3f8/?context=3
Of course not. During Mussolini's time* people could talk in the streets and stuff.

*Oops, looks like I gave away the ideology MMFA is supporting.


























[SITE]/comments/13ow3zd/is_twitter_amplifying_covid_conspiracies_and/
Why can't people like you post screenshots with links and provide supporting info? OK, I think I know why.

In my (currently fully shadowbanned) account I searched "covid" and the first tweet is "In September 2021, 41% of Democrats believed the COVID-19 hospitalization risk for the unvaccinated population was 50% or higher, while 79% thought it was 10% or higher. The correct answer was less than 1%. Why were Democrats so misinformed about the risks of COVID-19?" (KanekoaTheGreat/status/1660490927511863296).

Are the claims in that tweet wrong? I didn't click the link but I'm sure that if something about it is wrong, there are plenty of people showing it.

Why don't you focus on that, then if somehow the rebuttal is censored you'd have a point.
























[SITE]/comments/13nh1rm/twitter_appears_to_be_an_online_base_for_a/
Why can't you (Tony?) engage those tweets and show them wrong?

Also, **both** Musk and Vijaya heavily censor/censored replies to Russian, Chinese, and Iranian leaders. I didn't check Greek leaders but I'd imagine the same is true. Most of the complaints about Twitter are a blind man's zoo with few interested in just how extensive their censorship is.




































[SITE]/comments/13nebue/twitter_wants_me_to_doxx_myself_now/
Odd how all these claims rarely have any kind of proof.

Last week Jeopardy had a question about votes being "found" days later in an LBJ election. To mess with Twitter I filed a report accusing them of denying the results of an election. I wasn't asked for ID either. I've never been asked for ID by Twitter, they have locked my account a couple times until I accepted one of their phone calls, but that's it.

Facebook, OTOH, has requested govt ID twice. I didn't give it to them, losing an account in my own name (a common name, I was accused of impersonating someone perhaps an NHL player) and an account I had used to *pay them money* for ads.
































[SITE]/comments/13nz574/twitter_may_be_getting_a_new_ceo_but_musk_hasnt/
So, MMFA wants Twitter to let Big Biz decide the limits of debate.

There's a name for that, if anyone here is an actual liberal perhaps they can tell us what it is.





































[SITE]/comments/13lmvmb/there_are_2_reasons_why_so_much_nsfl_content_has/
As I've pointed out here several times - and been downvoted for it by those who never bring data like I do - Musk really hasn't changed much. In 2019, Vijaya censored half the replies to the president of Iran. In 2023, Musk censored half the replies to the head ayatollah of Iran. Musk heavily censors replies to Chinese officials just like Vijaya did, and on and on.

I posted to Github examples of how the Twitter algorithm does not work at all, with links to the original tweets and screenshots. I've rarely seen those who complain about things they don't like do the same.





































[SITE]/comments/13lv6es/twitter_app_wont_let_me_scroll_thru_my_feed_while/
It sounds like either Evil Musk's latest evil plan (Bwahaha!), or an inherent Android issue. I tether a phone (using EasyTether) and the connection stops when a call comes in or goes out.






































[SITE]/comments/13lxi2f/how_do_i_report_zoophiles/
"Explain to me how there's nothing wrong with [issue] and constantly arguing about it."

Now, try that with various controversial issues.

Putting Twitter in loco parentis - as if some Mechanical Turk workers should control what I can see - is extremely dim and extremely dangerous. Look at how grossly incompetent their algorithm is. They should decide the limits of debate?

You're welcome to make it your life's mission to monitor this person's feed and when they start posting pics or organizing events then you can report them to authorities.

[SITE]/comments/13ew11a/antivaxxer_plague/
The grown-up "solution" for you is to compile actual data - what specific accounts said when including links - and then call them on that later if they're shown wrong.

Wouldn't that be a lot healthier than whining and pushing censorship as you do now?





































[SITE]/comments/13fq8re/twitter_appeared_to_limit_the_reach_of/
Bellingcat isn't "investigative news" so much as Deep State.
I oppose censorship across the board, even of them and those I hate even more. Many at this subreddit want to pick and choose, censoring those who disagree with them and boosting those agree with them. IOW, they have more in common with Musk than with, say, Nadine Strossen.

I still have yet to see examples. Actual examples via links+screenshots, not just the "word" of randos.

[SITE]/comments/137swd8/twitter_seems_to_only_be_showing_a_select_handful/
I don't use Twitter to follow people, but the culprit is probably Twitter's extremely flawed algorithm. They're deciding what they think you should see, not what you want to see. See the discussions in the issue queue for the algorithm on Github.






























[SITE]/comments/13859f0/twitter_became_scary/
Post examples: screenshots and links.

There was a supposed Dutch guy supposedly pretending he saw flat earthers in his feed. In many years on the internet I've never seen a flat earther, yet we have a supposed Dutch guy supposedly seeing flat earthers.

These "Twitter has changed!!!!" posts seem to be more a case of mini-mass hysteria than anything else. Musk really hasn't changed that much. The Twitter algorithm is still censoring millions of people each day. It's still protecting the leaders of Iran, China, Russia, etc from dissent. DrPanMD can still block anyone who disagrees with him. Totalitarianism is still rampant on Twitter just as it always was.






























[SITE]/comments/13859f0/twitter_became_scary/
IOW, it was a good echo chamber for you to consume deceptive tales.

Look at all the anti-Newsom replies here: https://twitter.com/CAgovernor/status/1654211120360734720 Not that Musk has changed things as much as the emotionally-fragile imagine, but such a level of dissent would have been verboten before. I like it better this way.



































[SITE]/comments/135d24o/but_it_works_on_my_machine/
In case this isn't clear, the links in the message point to the dev's private installation. They should have filled in the correct links before making it live. 

Twitter has a habit of pushing things to the live site without doing any sort of testing.




































[SITE]/comments/135j3k3/do_we_think_the_algorithm_is_accounting_for/
The "algorithm" is on Github (check out the issue queue!)

It does a lot of very foolish things, like boosting images and considering blocks. I've been blocked by dozens of people and in almost all cases it should have counted against the blockers. For instance, the Cincy Reds blocked me for comparing their current politics to what Marge Schott allegedly believed. DrPanMD, ZitoSalena, and dozens more are infamous for blocking those who show them wrong or disagree with them. And, Twitter is enabling such behavior.

I see a lot of Paid Blue Checks being censored in replies (Twitter puts them in the "LowQuality" or "AbusiveQuality" sections, see the algo).

Years ago I created an alternative tweet ranker that only looks at the content of the tweet. It works a lot better than the Twitter algo. It took me about an hour to come up with my ranker.

A lot of Twitter's algo was probably devs selling their managers on "features" in order to keep working.

















[SITE]/comments/13404n0/why_is_nobody_talking_about_how_scandalous/
I have a fairly common name that I share with some kind of chef, an NHL player, a non-U.S. TV director, and lots more. I had a Facebook account under my real name. I never really used it except I had an FB app that I let go after a while. Out of the blue, FB accused me of impersonation and demanded I send them govt ID. (It wasn't phishing) I tried to get a human to talk to but never could.

I started another account using a fake name and spent a few $ on ads (using an Amex gift card). Apparently because I used a VPN or for some other obscure reason, FB demanded govt ID. When I didn't provide it they canceled my ads account. I wasn't in any way a big spender but c'mon that's no way to treat paying customers.

My Twitter suspensions, to the contrary, have all be over thoughtcrimes. In one case they suspended an account for three months before they finally answered my appeal by admitting they were wrong. Three months.

Both are horrible companies.





























[SITE]/comments/12rkg99/comment/jhz2olv/?context=3
As I've probably stated, I don't use Twitter like others. I only follow people to troll those looking at who I follow. I don't look at my home page, I just go to pages of political leaders and respond to them or respond to those replying to them. However, in my rare ventures into the home feed or similar, I'm not seeing what you're seeing.

The Twitter algo (which is extremely flawed) tries to personalize things so others probably see different tweets than you.





























[SITE]/comments/12tc32s/comment/jhz39c5/?context=3
widget anti-pattern
I assume that's a reference to Flutter, which I'm not familiar with.

Everything on a web page is some sort of widget, component, or whatever you want to call it. I'm typing into a textarea widget, there are list widgets to the right, on other pages there are image widgets, etc. The web should have started with just a few widgets like that + an open source editor that could be used to combine them. New widgets (like video players, 3D, etc) would have been added over time.
































[SITE]/comments/12z4vvn/you_can_be_transphobic_and_racist_all_day_long_on/
I've been banned by dozens of lib and con sites for showing them wrong. Breitbart blocked me for showing Trump wrong, Mother Jones blocked me for showing one of their writers wrong, etc etc.

On here, my comments that defy The Narrative get voted down, usually without anyone trying to make a counterargument.

If you object to that, the only solution is to oppose censorship across the board, including those you hate. E.g., I greatly dislike Dave Weigel (he lied about me & didn't give me a chance to reply), but the last thing I'd do is censor him even if I could.
































[SITE]/comments/130ll6p/33_days_without_an_answer_to_my_appeal/
Context would be helpful. What were you replying to? What's the link to?






































[SITE]/comments/12tc32s/comment/jhrjaa4/?context=3
And that can be done in different ways. Java applications have various ways to do it, Visual C++ has various ways to do it, even AOL had various ways to do it. HTML+CSS certainly isn't the worst way, but it's close to it.

Look at all the junk W3C has put out like a slider element. That could be a widget loaded from a trusted source. It would have various configurable display modes based on the environment: one for mobile, one accessible, one for desktop with 1024 wide, one for desktop with 4096 wide, etc etc.

If you want to filter out politicians you don't like, they should let you. Your choices shouldn't impact anyone else. If the reason you don't like seeing those politicians is because you think they're wrong, then focus on those who seem to be showing them wrong. If you aren't willing to engage opponents or support others who can engage opponents then just ignore them and move on. There are plenty of sites with cat pictures.

I've seen three such posts in the last few days all along the same lines. Couldn't you just consolidate them into one post?

Why are you reporting things just because you disagree with them? Since you're incapable of showing your opponents wrong, you should seek out leaders who are capable of showing those opponents wrong. In fact, if you provide proof of your claims, I'll help tell you how to show one of those people wrong.



































W3C/Tim Berners-Lee are a blight. The web should have been object-oriented and extensible (devolving to one plain text block), not the HTML/CSS mess. I won't go into the details here.

Twitter is used as the homepage or similar for thousands of elected officials. Their tweets are part of their job as public servants. Twitter encourages that (TwitterGov).

Then, Twitter decides who can reply to those officials and where/if their replies appear.


































[SITE]/comments/12rkg99/does_twitter_now_amplify_rightwingconspiracy/
Assuming you're telling the truth, maybe that's because Twitter expects you to reply to those tweets like others who agree with you have.

The reality is that, aside from a few high-profile but minor changes like restoring BB, Musk hasn't changed much.
When I checked in 2019, Vijaya was censoring half the replies to the president of Iran. When I checked in Feb 2023, Musk was censoring half the replies to the head ayatollah of Iran.
Just like Vijaya, Musk is censoring millions of people each day including lots of conservatives.

1. I doubt they can't mass remove blue checks. It's probably a field in the db, although given how technically incompetent Twitter is they might have some Goldbergian system in place.
2. Boosting tweets with images is yet another example of their incompetence. Those images are usually childish memes etc. My alternative ranking algo - which took me an hour to devise - de-boosts tweets that just have images and boosts tweets that use longer words, etc.
3. Limiting tweets based on blocks is yet another example. DrPanMD *hates* it when someone disagrees with him or shows him wrong and he frequently blocks people or hides their replies. That should be used against *him*, but Twitter uses it against those trying to hold him accountable.











































































































































































































































[SITE]/comments/129ivv1/analysis_of_twitter_algorithm_code_reveals_social/
I've been pointing out for years how extensive Twitter censorship is, and Musk really hasn't changed much. For instance, he's censoring half the replies to the head ayatollah of Iran. I doubt that's because he's a fan, it's just that Twitter engineering is grossly-incompetent and very pro-censorship. For instance, letting blocks impact your Social Score when in most cases they should only impact the blocker's score.

I can't see her video but I have a private page that does searches using the Twitter API. I only saw a few tweets for her handle + various swear words. They weren't that bad. I looked at one of her tweets with ~100 replies. Most of the "HighQuality" replies (which is what Twitter calls those above 'show more replies') were sympathetic. Several of the "LowQuality" replies (those after 'show more replies') weren't. Only one of the latter was questionable. That was when I was logged out so that view might be different.

Highlighting a few extreme cases in order to silence all dissent is a very old trick.

"Our research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed"
They also seem to be defining criticism of Soros as anti-antisemitism.
Plus, the idea that Musk has made Twitter a free speech paradise is ludicrous. My app that collects data on Twitter censorship shows they're censoring tweets at an equal or greater rate now than they were before.
For instance, in 2019 they censored about half the replies to Rouhani. In Feb 2023 they were censoring about half the replies to the head ayatollah. Musk really hasn't changed much beyond restoring a few accounts.

One of my accounts critical of Musk was fully shadowbanned (out of *API* search results, replies don't show anywhere, etc). Details.

P.S. What few seem to know is what Twitter calls the three levels on reply pages. The tweets before 'show more replies' are marked as "HighQuality" in Twitter's AJAX. Those after 'show more replies' are called "LowQuality". Those after the last button are called "AbusiveQuality". The first two labels rarely make sense and the last only makes sense on some occasions; it appears to use a simple swear word filter.

Millions of tweets end up in the "LowQuality" section each day. I wonder how those users would think of Twitter if they knew what Twitter was calling their tweets.

This advice is unfeasible if your goal is challenging political leaders. They aren't going to follow you and if you reply to them say two times in a day and reply to a couple of their supporters in the same day trying to undercut the leader to that supporter, Twitter might ban you. Those who started Twitter saw it as a way for friends to chat or for consumers to listen to pearls of wisdom from on high. They're aghast at it being used to engage in sharp-edged debate. And, Musk hasn't changed that one bit: he's still using blocks against the person blocked when in most cases it should be used against the person doing the blocking.
